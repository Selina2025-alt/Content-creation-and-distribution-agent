# Satori + resvg Social Card Skill

Use this skill when Xiaohongshu content needs designed image cards rather than generic AI images.

## Capabilities

- Build image prompts as code-native card specs: canvas size, typography, grid, color tokens, decorative shapes, and export target.
- Create Xiaohongshu carousel cards with consistent cover, method, comparison, checklist, framework, and CTA pages.
- Favor editorial social-card aesthetics: bold display title, short subtitle, readable body, controlled whitespace, and brand accents.
- Source inspiration: vercel/satori and thx/resvg-js.

## Workflow

1. Decide the card role: cover, concept, framework, checklist, comparison, scene, summary, or CTA.
2. Specify canvas ratio for Xiaohongshu, usually 3:4 portrait or square.
3. Write a compact visual spec with layout, type scale, color palette, and text hierarchy.
4. Keep every series card connected through shared palette, motif, and footer markers.

# Rough.js Hand-drawn Knowledge Card Skill

Use this skill when the content should feel human, hand-made, and easy to save.

## Capabilities

- Generate hand-drawn knowledge cards with rough-stuff/rough style strokes.
- Use hand-drawn boxes, arrows, stars, dividers, sticky notes, and warm paper backgrounds.

- Keep the mood warm and approachable while maintaining strong information hierarchy.

## Rules

- Use hand-drawn visual language: uneven strokes, doodle arrows, organic outlines, and simple icons.
- Put the core takeaway in one large title and keep each supporting point short.
- Avoid dense paragraphs inside the image; split into 3-6 digestible blocks.
- For Xiaohongshu carousel, keep a repeated motif across all cards.
